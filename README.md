# Hotels_Menu_CRUD
<!-- an Express server that connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose and includes authentication via Passport.js with a local strategy. The server listens on a port defined in the environment variables or defaults to port 3000. It defines models for Person and MenuItem schemas, including hashing passwords with bcrypt for secure authentication. Middleware is used to parse JSON requests and log incoming requests. The server also initializes Passport for handling authentication. Two main routes are defined, /person and /menu, which handle CRUD operations for the Person and MenuItem models respectively. These routes facilitate operations such as adding, fetching, updating, and deleting records in the MongoDB database. The server listens for requests and logs activity, providing a foundation for a web application with secure user authentication and robust data management. -->
